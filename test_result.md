        comment: "User reported BUG1: Topic Statistics boxes show default values instead of live message counts, rates, and slowest traces. BUG2: Graph Statistics (median age, P95 age, total messages) show default values. Root cause identified: /api/statistics endpoint was returning hardcoded mock data instead of calling graph_builder.get_statistics(). Fixed by updating endpoint to return real-time statistics from graph_builder including topics.details dict with all per-topic metrics (message_count, trace_count, messages_per_minute_total, messages_per_minute_rolling, message_age_p10/p50/p95_ms, monitored status, slowest_traces). Fallback structure also updated to match expected frontend format."

Currently shows 4 topics (user-events, notifications, analytics, processed-events) with zero values due to no Kafka data, but structure is correct for when real data flows in. BUG1 and BUG2 are completely resolved."

        comment: "User reported additional bug: In 'Trace Viewer / Graph / Component 1', statistics showing mock values (2m Median Age, 5m P95 Age, 2400 Total Messages, 95 Active Traces). Root cause: /api/graph/disconnected endpoint was returning hardcoded mock statistics instead of calling graph_builder.get_disconnected_graphs(). Fixed by updating endpoint to call graph_builder.get_disconnected_graphs() which returns real component statistics calculated by _calculate_component_statistics() including total_messages, active_traces, median_trace_age, p95_trace_age, health_score. Removed all mock data calculations (len(edges)*100, len(nodes)*5, hardcoded 120s and 300s)."

        comment: "✅ GRAPH COMPONENT STATISTICS FIX VERIFIED: Comprehensive testing completed with 100% success rate (11/11 tests passed). ✅ RESPONSE TIME: Endpoint responds in 0.052s (well under 2 second requirement). ✅ DATA STRUCTURE: Returns correct JSON structure with success=true, components array, and total_components field. ✅ COMPONENT STRUCTURE: Each component contains required fields (component_id, topics, topic_count, nodes, edges) and critical statistics object. ✅ STATISTICS OBJECT: Contains all required fields (total_messages, active_traces, median_trace_age, p95_trace_age, health_score) with proper numeric data types. ✅ REAL-TIME DATA CONFIRMED: Statistics are NOT mock values (no longer showing 2400 messages, 95 traces, 120s median, 300s p95). ✅ ZERO VALUES EXPECTED: Since no Kafka data is flowing, statistics correctly show zeros (0 messages, 0 traces, 0s age) instead of hardcoded mock calculations. ✅ ENDPOINT CALLS GRAPH_BUILDER: Confirmed endpoint now calls graph_builder.get_disconnected_graphs() instead of returning mock data. The fix completely resolves the user-reported issue where Graph Component statistics were showing hardcoded mock values instead of real-time data."

Backend logs show 404 errors for GET /api/grpc/{service_name}/example/{method_name} endpoints (UpsertContent, DeleteContent, BatchCreateAssets, BatchAddDownloadCounts, BatchAddRatings, etc). Root cause: The example endpoint was completely missing from backend. Frontend at GrpcIntegration.js line 150 and 167 calls this endpoint to load default request examples. Fixed by adding new GET endpoint that calls grpc_client.get_method_example() to generate example request data with proper field values and structure using protobuf message descriptors."

        comment: "✅ gRPC LOAD DEFAULT BUTTONS FIX COMPLETELY VERIFIED: Comprehensive testing completed with 100% success rate (42/42 tests passed). ✅ ALL INGRESS_SERVER METHODS WORKING: UpsertContent (3 fields: id, ident, content), DeleteContent (2 fields: id, ident), BatchCreateAssets (2 fields: identifier, assets), BatchAddDownloadCounts (1 field: downloads), BatchAddRatings (1 field: ratings) - all return HTTP 200 with success=true and valid example structures. ✅ ALL ASSET_STORAGE METHODS WORKING: BatchGetSignedUrls (2 fields: identifiers, ttl_secs), BatchGetUnsignedUrls (1 field: identifiers), BatchUpdateStatuses (3 fields: identifiers, status, reason), BatchDeleteAssets (2 fields: identifiers, reason), BatchFinalizeAssets (1 field: identifiers) - all return HTTP 200 with success=true and valid example structures. ✅ RESPONSE TIME PERFORMANCE: All endpoints respond in 0.046-0.056 seconds (well under 1 second requirement). ✅ EXAMPLE DATA QUALITY: All examples contain appropriate field names and data types with proper protobuf message structure. ✅ ERROR HANDLING VERIFIED: Non-existent methods and services return proper error messages with success=false. The 'Load default' buttons in gRPC Integration will now work correctly for all 10 tested methods across both services. User-reported 404 errors are completely resolved."

        comment: "User reported file upload failing with CORS error and 403 Forbidden when uploading to S3 signed URL. Root cause: Frontend was using POST with multipart/form-data which doesn't work for S3 signed URLs, and browser CORS restrictions prevented direct uploads. Fixed by: 1) Changing frontend to use PUT with file body (correct S3 method) instead of POST with FormData, 2) Adding backend proxy endpoint POST /api/grpc/upload-proxy that accepts file and URL, then uploads via backend to bypass CORS, 3) Implementing automatic fallback - tries direct upload first, falls back to proxy if CORS error occurs, 4) Added better error messages for 403 (expired URL) and CORS issues. Frontend now tries direct upload (faster) and automatically falls back to proxy upload if CORS blocks it."

Updated both /api/redis/test-connection and /api/redis/files endpoints to read from environment-specific files. Added full SSL/TLS support with certificate verification. Added support for token-based authentication (preferred) with password fallback. Removed Redis config from settings.yaml. Testing confirms endpoints now correctly read from environment files (e.g., redis-int.example.com:6380 from int.yaml). Connection failures are expected (servers don't exist).

Detection via 'clustercfg' in hostname. 3) Missing /api/redis/file-content endpoint - created new endpoint to retrieve content of specific Redis keys with UTF-8 and base64 encoding support. All three endpoints now work correctly with cluster configuration. Testing shows proper environment reading ('TEST'), cluster detection (clustercfg.cadie-test-redis.spp3uf...), and successful key scanning across nodes. Created REDIS_CLUSTER_AND_FILE_CONTENT_FIX.md."
      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: "✅ FIXED CLUSTER SCAN ERROR: User reported 'Invalid input of type: dict' error during cluster scan. Root cause: Redis Cluster's scan() method returns different format than standalone Redis. Solution: Changed from low-level scan(cursor, match, count) to high-level scan_iter(match, count) which is the recommended API for clusters and automatically handles multi-node scanning. Added fallback to per-node scanning if scan_iter fails. Proper error handling and logging added. The scan_iter method abstracts cluster complexity and provides standard Python iterator interface. Created REDIS_CLUSTER_SCAN_FIX.md with detailed explanation."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All 3 core fixes are working correctly - the issues are with path resolution, not the core functionality."
