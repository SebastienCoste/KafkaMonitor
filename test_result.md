# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ VERIFIED: Blueprint Creator navigation is working correctly. Comprehensive Playwright testing shows: 1) All navigation buttons (Trace Viewer, gRPC Integration, Blueprint Creator) are visible and clickable, 2) Button click events are firing properly - buttons change styling to active state when clicked, 3) Page content switches correctly - clicking Blueprint Creator shows 'Setup Blueprint Creator' interface with directory selection, 4) State management working - currentPage state changes from 'traces' to 'blueprint' to 'grpc' as expected, 5) Conditional rendering logic working - only the selected page content is visible at any time, 6) No JavaScript errors detected during navigation, 7) WebSocket connections established properly for Blueprint Creator. All three navigation buttons work perfectly: Trace Viewer shows trace content, gRPC Integration shows setup page, Blueprint Creator shows directory selection interface. The reported issue appears to be resolved - navigation is fully functional."

Root cause was shared saveDialogOpen and currentSaveContext state across all method cards. Solution: Made save dialog state method-specific by converting saveDialogOpen and saveName to objects with method-specific keys, removed shared currentSaveContext state that was causing conflicts. Each method now has independent save dialog with proper context isolation."

The Phase 2 fixes are properly implemented in code but cannot be fully tested due to initialization timing issue.
