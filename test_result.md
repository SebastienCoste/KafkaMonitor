# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🔧 PHASE 2 UI FIXES COMPLETED: ✅ RefreshCw Icon Import: Already properly imported on line 30 and used in 'Reload Credentials' button. ✅ Load Button Placement Bug Fix: Fixed the issue where 'Load save' button was appearing in wrong place for UpsertContent (next to BatchAddRatings). Root cause was shared saveDialogOpen and currentSaveContext state across all method cards. Solution: Made save dialog state method-specific by converting saveDialogOpen and saveName to objects with method-specific keys, removed shared currentSaveContext state that was causing conflicts. Each method now has independent save dialog with proper context isolation."

    message: "🔍 PHASE 2 UI FIXES TESTING RESULTS: ✅ CODE REVIEW VERIFICATION: Confirmed RefreshCw icon is properly imported (line 30) and used in 'Reload Credentials' button (line 846). Verified Load Button Placement Bug Fix implementation - saveDialogOpen and saveName are now method-specific objects, eliminating cross-contamination between methods. ✅ BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY: gRPC initialization working correctly on backend (logs show successful initialization with available services). ❌ FRONTEND INITIALIZATION ISSUE: gRPC client initialization not completing on frontend - page remains in 'gRPC Integration Setup' mode preventing full UI testing. The Phase 2 fixes are properly implemented in code but cannot be fully tested due to initialization timing issue. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate frontend gRPC initialization completion logic or add timeout handling for initialization response."

All 4 topics tested with valid field types and values. Topics without messages correctly return 0 values and empty arrays. ✅ REQ2: Graceful topic handling verified - Kafka consumer subscription working, system continues operating without failing when topics don't exist, proper warning logs for missing topics. All required API endpoints accessible: GET /api/statistics (main focus), GET /api/topics, GET /api/grpc/status. Response format matches review request specification exactly.
