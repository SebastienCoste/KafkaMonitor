The AI engineer's work involved an extensive journey from initial bug fixes to a major new feature, the Blueprint Creator, followed by multiple iterative rounds of bug resolution and feature refinement based on user feedback. Key early tasks included resolving frontend URL configuration () and backend  errors. The core development focused on the Blueprint Creator, encompassing backend API endpoints, file/build managers, and comprehensive frontend UI components for file management (create, edit, delete, rename, drag-and-drop), syntax-highlighted editing, real-time build console via WebSockets, and deployment. Recurring challenges included frontend navigation issues, API payload mismatches (e.g.,  for deployment), CodeMirror version conflicts leading to a white page, and subtle CSS issues like missing  classes for hover effects. The AI consistently used testing agents and detailed log analysis to diagnose and verify fixes, demonstrating a robust, iterative development cycle that rigorously addressed all user-reported defects and enhancements.

The application visualizes Kafka message flows with real-time Kafka consumption, protobuf decoding, in-memory trace storage, REST/WebSocket APIs, and a React UI.

**Previously Implemented (prior to this trajectory):** gRPC integration, Kafka Trace Viewer enhancements (topic stats, slowest traces), and various refinements (graceful topic handling, trace ID visibility, , overall speed, graph loading fixes).

**Blueprint Creator Feature Requirements:**
A new tab for Blueprint Creator:
*   Users can select and browse a root folder on their system.
*   Manage blueprint files: create, edit (syntax-highlighted: JSON, JSLT, Protobuf, Markdown, Shell, YAML), upload, drag-and-drop, delete, rename files/folders.
*   Integrated blueprint building with real-time build console output (WebSockets).
*   Deploy (validate/activate) blueprint  artifacts to environment-configured blueprint servers using specific API and authentication (PUT with binary payload, namespace in URL).
*   Auto-refresh file tree every 30 seconds with a user-controllable toggle.
*   Backend configuration for blueprint servers and environments.
*   Ability to run  and  scripts (later removed).
*   Allow multiple blueprint files in tabs, with correct content switching.
*   Auto-call file-tree on blueprint project load.
*   More verbose logging for deployment and script execution.
*   Browse for directory to select a folder path, not upload contents.
*   Auto-refresh immediately when a folder is loaded.
*   Increase file editor window size (resizable).
*   Deployment APIs (validate/activate) should treat any 2XX status code as success.
*   Enhanced file/folder UI: stronger colors for file content, and visible create/rename/delete buttons on folder hover.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully addressed the final set of user-reported issues for the Blueprint Creator feature:

1.  **FIX 1 (Darker Colors)**: The  component was updated to use the  theme with  and the textarea for edit mode was also styled to provide stronger, darker colors for file content, enhancing readability.
2.  **FIX 2 (Folder Hover Buttons)**: The  component was modified to add the  Tailwind CSS class to the directory container. This rectified an issue where the create, rename, and delete buttons (which relied on ) were not visible when hovering over folders in the file explorer.

Both of these fixes were implemented, and comprehensive frontend testing confirmed that they are working correctly, making all previously reported issues and feature requests fully functional and verified. The Blueprint Creator is now ready for use with all requested enhancements.
