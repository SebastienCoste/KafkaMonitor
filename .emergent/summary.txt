The trajectory details the development of a Blueprint Configuration UI, initially by fixing existing functionalities, and then implementing a new Git Integration feature. Previous work involved resolving Redis API 404s, refactoring the Redis client for cluster compatibility, and making the Kafka-based Trace Viewer fully functional by integrating real-time data. gRPC integration was enhanced with example payload generation and stable S3 file uploads, requiring specific header handling. Blueprint Creator issues, such as environment overrides loading and deployment with a build manager, were also addressed.

The current trajectory focused on building the Git Integration feature, including backend  development, API endpoint creation, frontend UI component integration, and comprehensive testing. Following user feedback, several critical security and implementation issues in the Git service were identified and resolved, such as credential handling, URL validation, and  corruption. The work concluded with thorough re-testing of the fixed Git integration on both backend and frontend.

<product_requirements>
The application serves as a Blueprint Configuration UI, enabling developers to manage and monitor complex application configurations and data flows.

**Existing Features:**
1.  **Redis Connectivity:** Verifies connections and views configurations for standalone and clustered Redis, loading from environment-specific YAMLs.
2.  **gRPC Service Interaction:** Dynamic API calls, file uploads to S3 via a backend proxy (handling signed URLs, ,  headers), and correct display of asset storage URLs.
3.  **Kafka Trace Viewer:** Displays real-time Kafka message flows, processing with Protobuf decoders, building trace graphs, and exposing live topic/graph statistics. Frontend provides auto-refreshing views.
4.  **Blueprint Deployments:** Validates and activates blueprint packages using a , resolving file paths, and loading environment-specific server configurations with detailed logs.
5.  **Configuration Management (Blueprint Creator):** Creates Storage Services and Host Configurations. Environment Overrides loads existing configs, adds new host configs with defaults, handles dotted map keys, merges overrides, and generates lowercase environment names.

**New Feature: Git Integration (Blueprint Creator)**
Users need to select a project via Git URL and branch, clone it into an  folder (which becomes the Blueprint Creator's root). The feature includes buttons for:
*   Pushing changes to the remote repo (adding all files, commit message, optional force push).
*   Resetting local changes.
*   Changing branches.
The integration provides real-time progress via WebSockets, input validation, credential management, and sandboxed operations.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI app, API routes, WebSockets, global state.
    -   **Changes**: Added Git API endpoints (, , etc.), initialized  during startup, and passed the Git configuration path to it. Also, previously modified for Kafka Trace Viewer, gRPC, and Blueprint deployment.
-   **** (NEW)
    -   **Importance**: Encapsulates all Git operations (clone, pull, push, branch, reset, status). Central to the new Git Integration feature.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch. Enhanced with robust input validation (, ), secure credential handling via environment variables (, ), improved  for secure subprocess execution, and comprehensive error handling in . It loads configuration from .
-   **** (NEW)
    -   **Importance**: Configuration file for the , defining allowed Git hosts and the integrator path.
    -   **Changes**: Created, initially empty, then updated with  and .
-   **** (NEW)
    -   **Importance**: Ensures the  directory (where Git repositories are cloned) exists in the codebase.
    -   **Changes**: Created as an empty file.
-   **** (NEW)
    -   **Importance**: Provides the user interface for all Git operations within the Blueprint Creator.
    -   **Changes**: Created. Implements UI elements for Git URL, branch selection, clone, pull, push, reset, and branch change. Communicates with backend Git API endpoints. Fixed a typo ( to ).
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates the Blueprint Creator tabs and content.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated the new  component by adding a Git tab and setting it as the default active tab.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
    -   **Changes**: Replaced a corrupted  file with a clean version to prevent unintended file tracking.

<pending_tasks>
No explicit pending tasks were left unresolved in the provided trajectory. The Git Integration feature, including its fixes for security and implementation issues, has been fully implemented and thoroughly tested on both the backend and frontend. The AI engineer has provided a final summary indicating completion.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work involved fixing critical security vulnerabilities and implementation issues identified in the newly developed Git Integration feature. The AI engineer addressed several problems:
1.  **Secure Credential Handling**: Modified  to use  and  environment variables instead of embedding credentials directly in Git URLs during clone operations.
2.  **Input Validation**: Enhanced  to be more strict, incorporating  from the new  configuration.  was also improved.
3.  **Command Execution**: Refined the  method in  for safer subprocess execution, adding  and  for better error handling.
4.  **Error Handling**: Improved exception handling within  for better robustness.
5.  **Configuration Management**: Created and correctly configured  to centralize Git service settings like  and . The  and  were updated to load and utilize this configuration.
6.  **Corrupted File Fix**: Replaced a corrupted  file to ensure proper exclusion of files.

After implementing these fixes, the backend was restarted and its status confirmed. The  endpoint was tested to verify basic Git functionality. Finally, comprehensive frontend UI testing () was performed, confirming that all Git Integration functionality, including the security fixes, is working as expected.
