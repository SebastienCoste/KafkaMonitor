The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Kafka trace viewer application from initial bug fixes and minor enhancements to a major new feature: the Blueprint Creator. The initial phase involved resolving a persistent frontend configuration issue where  incorrectly defaulted to , which was traced to an overriding  file. A recurring  missing error on the backend was also addressed.

Once stable, the focus shifted to implementing the comprehensive Blueprint Creator feature, adhering to a detailed technical design document. This involved extensive development across both backend (new models, file/build managers, API endpoints, config updates) and frontend (new components, tab integration, UI logic). The AI engineer iteratively addressed numerous user-reported bugs, including critical frontend navigation failures, deployment API path corrections, enhanced file management (deletion, drag-and-drop), real-time build console output via WebSockets, and environment configuration persistence. New features like syntax highlighting, multi-file tab editing, and direct script execution were also integrated. A key challenge was reconciling the screenshot agent's persistent display of the Trace Viewer with the user's detailed feedback on the Blueprint Creator's UI and functionality, which implied successful navigation. The AI consistently prioritized user feedback for functional validation. The trajectory concluded with the AI debugging and fixing several deployment-related API issues and enhancing logging.

<product_requirements>
The application is a real-time Kafka trace viewer, visualizing Kafka message flows with core functionalities including Kafka consumption, protobuf decoding, in-memory trace storage, REST/WebSocket APIs, and a React UI.

**Previously Implemented Features & Fixes:**
*   **gRPC Integration**: Dynamic service/method discovery, example content, request persistence,  template, credentials persistence, Reload Credentials, fix for Load Button Placement (method-specific dialogs),  error resolution.
*   **Kafka Trace Viewer (REQ1)**: Topic statistics (messages per minute, rolling 60s window, overall rate), 3 slowest traces (TraceID, time to topic, total duration).
*   **Refinements (REQ2, BUG1-3)**: Graceful handling of non-existent topics, full trace ID visibility, corrected time to topic calculation, accurate overall speed (rate not total count), graph loading fix (missing 'rate' key), integration of external GitHub changes (default environment, logging, trace ID parsing).

**Newly Introduced Blueprint Creator Feature Requirements:**
*   New Blueprint Creator tab within existing KafkaMonitor.
*   Users can select and browse a root folder on their system.
*   Manage blueprint files (create, edit, upload, drag-and-drop, delete files/folders, rename files/folders).
*   Syntax-highlighted editing for JSON, JSLT, and Protobuf files.
*   Integrate blueprint building with real-time build console output (WebSockets).
*   Deploy (validate/activate) blueprint  artifacts to environment-configured blueprint servers using proper API and authentication (PUT method with binary payload, namespace in URL).
*   Auto-refresh file tree every 30 seconds with user-controllable toggle.
*   Configuration for blueprint servers and environments in .
*   Ability to run  and  scripts with environment and API key parameters, and view their output.
*   Allow multiple blueprint files to be open in tabs.
*   Auto-call file-tree on blueprint project load.
*   More verbose logging for deployment and script execution.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a new set of requirements and bug fixes for the Blueprint Creator feature. This involved:

1.  **Syntax Highlighting (REQ1)**: Integrating CodeMirror with language extensions (JSON, YAML, Protobuf, JSLT, Shell) into  for enhanced readability.
2.  **Multi-file Tabs (REQ2)**: Updating  and  to support opening several files in a tabbed interface, and creating a new  component to manage these tabs.
3.  **Auto-call  on Load (REQ4)**: Modifying  to automatically refresh the file tree when the blueprint project folder is loaded or changed.
4.  **Deployment/Script Endpoint Fixes and Logging (REQ5 & REQ6)**: Investigating and adding more verbose logging to the backend deployment endpoints (, , , ). The AI identified that the endpoints were expecting POST with binary files in the URL path, leading to 405 errors, and was in the process of rectifying this.

The work on REQ5 and REQ6, specifically fixing the 405/422 errors for deployment and script execution, was ongoing. The AI had already added verbose logging to these endpoints and was examining the routing logic in  to ensure correct HTTP methods and payload handling. The backend testing previously confirmed all 8 initial fixes were working at the API level, but the frontend navigation issue had been a recurring challenge, which the user's latest feedback implied was resolved.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Address the 405 Method Not Allowed errors for deployment/script execution by correcting API routing and payload handling, and continue to add verbose logging as requested by the user.
