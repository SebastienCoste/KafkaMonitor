The AI engineer successfully enhanced a Kafka trace viewer, focusing on two major features: gRPC Integration and Graph Visualization Evolution, followed by several critical bug fixes and refactors. Initially, the project was broadened by user requests to include gRPC API integration, requiring new backend services (proto loader, gRPC client) and a dedicated frontend page. Simultaneously, the graph visualization was significantly enhanced to support real-time statistics, disconnected graphs, and improved UI/UX, including centering the graph on screen. Key challenges involved resolving protobuf import conflicts, fixing trace age calculation logic, and repeatedly debugging complex React JSX syntax errors in  that prevented frontend compilation. The engineer also implemented Kafka configuration using environment variables and addressed other reported UI inconsistencies. The work concluded with persistent frontend JSX errors despite multiple attempts, blocking full verification of other fixes.

8.  **UI/UX**: Wider central panel, scrollable messages, select all/none topic buttons, graph visualization.

**Additional Features/Improvements (User-Requested):**
1.  **Graph Visualization Evolution**: Show all topic graphs (disconnected, vertical, ordered by topic count). Real-time message stats (counts, rates, median trace ages by node color: green, orange, red). Stats panel for P10, P50, P95 trace age. Filtering (last X minutes/since launch), near real-time updates. Reuse  (zoom/pan). Mock disconnected graphs with cyclic loops.
2.  **gRPC Integration Page**: Dedicated page for gRPC calls to  (UpsertContent, BatchCreateAssets, BatchAddDownloadCounts, BatchAddRatings) and  (BatchGetSignedUrls, BatchUpdateStatuses) using provided proto definitions (never committed, locally supplied). Environment selection (DEV/TEST/INT/LOAD/PROD) with separate config files. In-memory credentials (Authorization, X-POP-TOKEN). Unlimited retries, UI error display. Single-user, single-page UI.
3.  **Refinements/Fixes**: Kafka server URL/login/password as environment variables. Fix duplicated topic messages on trace page. Show statistics per topic on topic page. Fix graph metrics increasing with time (regression). Fix  stub failure. Resolve  compilation issues.

-   Address the  endpoint hanging issue in gRPC integration, investigating gRPC server reachability or client configuration for the actual calls.
-   Adapt environment variables for the  presigned URL, as it is noted to be different from other APIs.
-   Ensure the topic page displays statistics per topic instead of trace messages, once frontend compilation issues are resolved.
-   Re-verify and fix if necessary the graph page overall metrics (age calculation), as the user reported it's still increasing with time.
-   Incorporate user-uploaded proto files for gRPC integration (pending user clarification/re-upload, as the agent couldn't access them).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving critical frontend JSX compilation errors in . These errors, specifically Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag and Unexpected token , were preventing the  process from succeeding. The engineer made multiple attempts to fix complex nested ternary operators and conditional rendering logic within , which manages the main page navigation (), tab switching (), and conditional display of the Kafka Trace Viewer and gRPC Integration components. The last action involved a significant rewrite of a section in  to simplify and correct the JSX structure in an attempt to resolve these persistent syntax issues. This ongoing frontend fix is a blocking issue, preventing full verification of other recent fixes and the implementation of further UI changes like the topic page statistics. The backend services (Kafka and gRPC) were restarted and confirmed to be running, but the frontend's build failure is the immediate focus.

<optional_next_step>
Continue debugging and fixing the JSX syntax errors in  to enable a successful frontend build.
