The trajectory documents an intensive, iterative debugging and feature implementation cycle for a Blueprint Configuration UI. The work began by resolving a critical 404 error on the  endpoint. This involved a deep dive into backend logging, direct API testing with , and identifying a misconfiguration where the application was reading from a global  instead of environment-specific files. The engineer corrected this logic to properly load Redis settings from .

The user then revealed that the Redis instance was a cluster, requiring the engineer to refactor the Redis client from  to  and handle differences in the  method's return format. Subsequent user feedback led to fixing several other broken or missing features. Key fixes included: restoring missing deployment endpoints (, ) by using FastAPI's  parameter to handle full file paths; implementing a missing generic gRPC call endpoint (); and adding a large number of missing API endpoints from a user-provided  file, including those for credentials and file management.

The final, most extensive part of the trajectory focused on making the Kafka-based Trace Viewer functional. This was a multi-step process:
1.  Initializing the Kafka consumer on application startup.
2.  Correctly passing environment-specific Kafka credentials.
3.  Calling the  method to begin polling for messages.
4.  Loading Protobuf decoders for Kafka topics.
5.  Fixing the  endpoint to return actual data from the .
6.  Implementing missing  endpoints.
7.  Fixing a frontend JavaScript error ().
8.  Correcting the backend endpoints for topic statistics and graph data to return real-time data instead of static or incorrect information.

The work concluded while debugging why the frontend still displayed default values for topic statistics, despite the backend API now seemingly returning correct data.

<product_requirements>
The application is a Blueprint Configuration UI, a comprehensive web tool for developers to manage, deploy, and monitor complex application configurations and data flows.

**Core User Goals & Implemented Features:**
1.  **Verify Service Connectivity**: Users must be able to verify connections to external services like Redis for different environments (e.g., TEST, INT). This includes listing and viewing configuration files stored in Redis. The implementation now supports both standalone and clustered Redis instances, reading configuration from environment-specific YAML files.
2.  **Interact with gRPC Services**: The UI must provide a way to make calls to various gRPC services. This was implemented by creating a dynamic backend endpoint () and adding a file upload feature to the UI for authentication purposes.
3.  **Monitor Kafka Topics**: A Trace Viewer must allow users to see real-time message flows between Kafka topics. The implementation involved building a backend service that consumes Kafka messages, processes them using Protobuf decoders, builds a trace graph, and exposes this data via API endpoints for statistics and graph visualization. The frontend provides auto-refreshing views for traces, topics, and a visual graph.
4.  **Manage Blueprint Deployments**: Users need to validate and activate blueprint packages ( files) through the UI. The backend endpoints for these actions were fixed to correctly handle file paths passed from the frontend.
5.  **Stable and Complete API**: The backend must provide all necessary endpoints for the frontend to function. Numerous missing endpoints for credentials, environment switching, and file operations were restored from a previous version.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: The core backend framework for building REST APIs, WebSocket endpoints, and managing application state and startup events.
- **React.js**: The frontend library used to build the entire user interface, manage component state, and handle asynchronous API calls.
- **Redis Cluster**: The application was updated to use the  library to connect to and scan keys in an AWS ElastiCache (Redis Cluster) instance, which required different connection and data handling logic than a standalone Redis instance.
- **Kafka Integration**: A  was implemented to consume messages from various topics in real-time. This involved handling environment-specific configurations (SASL/SSL), Protobuf decoding, and managing the consumer lifecycle (start/stop) during environment switches.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a standard monorepo with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React.js/Vite frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application file. It defines all API routes, WebSocket connections, global state management (), and startup/shutdown events. It orchestrates all other backend services like the  and .
    -   **Changes**: This file was the most heavily modified. Numerous endpoints were added or fixed, including those for Redis (), gRPC (), blueprint deployment (), and the entire suite of Trace Viewer endpoints (, , ). Logic was added to the startup event to initialize the gRPC and Kafka clients.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance**: These files contain the core logic for the Trace Viewer feature.  handles connecting to Kafka, subscribing to topics, and processing messages.  takes the processed messages and builds an in-memory representation of traces and topic statistics.
    -   **Changes**:  was debugged to ensure it started correctly and used the right credentials. A  method was implemented and called.  was modified to correctly expose trace and topic data through methods like  and , which were then used by .

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The root component of the React application. It handles routing, global state management, and fetching initial data for features like the Trace Viewer.
    -   **Changes**: An auto-refresh mechanism using  inside a  hook was added to regularly fetch trace data. A critical bug was fixed where a variable was incorrectly named  instead of , causing a blank page. The logic for fetching and displaying topic statistics is located here and was the subject of the final debugging session.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The UI component for the gRPC Integration feature.
    -   **Changes**: CSS was added to enable word-wrapping in the response viewer for better readability. A new UI section for file uploads was added, including state management () and an  handler function to manage the upload process. A variable naming conflict () was resolved to fix a compilation error.

<pending_tasks>
- **BUG1**: In Trace viewer / Topics / Topic Statistics, the individual topic boxes still show default values instead of updating with real-time data for message counts, rates, and slowest traces.
- **BUG2**: In Trace viewer / Graph, the overall statistics (median age, P95 age, total messages) above the graph are not updating with real-time data.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The engineer was actively debugging why the Trace Viewer frontend was not displaying real-time statistics for Kafka topics, even though the backend was successfully consuming messages and the relevant API endpoints were fixed.

The user reported two specific bugs:
1.  **Topic Statistics Not Updating**: The individual cards for each topic in the Topic Statistics view show default/zero values instead of live data.
2.  **Graph Statistics Not Updating**: The summary statistics displayed above the topic graph (e.g., median age, total messages) also show default values.

The last actions taken by the engineer were to investigate the frontend code in ****. The engineer confirmed that the backend endpoint () was returning a flat array of topic details. However, it was suspected that the frontend component expects a different, possibly nested, JSON structure to correctly parse and display the statistics. The engineer's immediate goal was to understand the data structure expected by the React components in  to resolve this mismatch between the backend's response and the frontend's expectation.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate  to determine the expected data structure for topic statistics and adjust the  endpoint in  to match it, ensuring the UI displays real-time data.
