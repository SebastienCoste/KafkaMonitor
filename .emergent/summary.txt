The AI engineer has been meticulously working on a Kafka trace viewer application, inherited after its initial development by another AI. The primary focus has been on enhancing and stabilizing gRPC integration, fixing numerous bugs, and improving the user interface. Significant efforts were directed towards resolving complex protobuf and Python module system issues, including message class not found errors, incorrect message construction for nested and  fields, and  handling. The UI was made dynamic, with features like service/method discovery, example generation, and request persistence. Recently, the engineer tackled issues related to  and  compatibility, missing methods in the UI due to hardcoding, and a critical bug where gRPC request headers were not being sent. The current work is focused on refining credential persistence and ensuring the  response is correctly extracted and displayed, alongside fixing UI placement bugs for saved examples. Multiple backend restarts and  re-installations indicate environmental challenges.

The application serves as a real-time Kafka trace viewer, visualizing Kafka message flows with core functionalities including Kafka consumption, protobuf decoding, in-memory trace storage, REST/WebSocket APIs, and a React UI.
Key enhancements requested by the user and partially implemented:
1.  **Graph Visualization**: Display of topic graphs, real-time message statistics (counts, rates, P10/P50/P95 trace age), time filtering,  reuse (zoom/pan, larger window size), and mock graphs.
2.  **gRPC Integration**: A dedicated UI for  and  calls. This involves dynamic loading of proto definitions, environment selection, in-memory credentials (now with persistence), limited retries, UI error display, dynamic method discovery and rendering (all methods now visible), example content generation (now full-depth), request data persistence (with naming and selection), and  template variable replacement.
3.  **Refinements/Fixes**: Handling Kafka server credentials as environment variables, fixing duplicated topic messages, showing per-topic statistics, fixing increasing graph metrics,  stub failure (still being addressed for response),  issues, graceful handling of non-existent Kafka topics, multiple asset-storage URLs per environment, configurable default topic activation, and fixing  for gRPC calls.

-   **BatchGetSignedUrls Response Data**: The  field in the  response is still not correctly extracted and displayed, showing  due to persistent  module issues.
-   **Load Button Placement (UI bug)**: The Load save button for named examples is still appearing in the wrong place for  (next to ).
-   **Send Headers/Credentials**: Headers are not being sent with gRPC requests, preventing proper authentication/authorization. Debugging confirmed NO METADATA/HEADERS being sent!.
-   **Log Raw Response String**: The user explicitly requested to log the raw response string before deserialization for debugging.
-   **Import  icon**: The AI is in the process of adding this import for the new Reload Credentials button.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues within the gRPC integration:

1.  ** Response Extraction**: The core problem is that despite successful gRPC calls to the backend, the  response data, specifically the  field, is not being correctly extracted and returned to the frontend. The backend logs show that the  field is identified, but attempts to access its content fail with a  error. The AI has implemented multiple fallback methods for response conversion and direct field access, but the issue persists. The current fix attempt involves a completely different approach to bypass problematic protobuf internal machinery, and a more direct  approach.

2.  **Missing Headers/Credentials**: The user reported that gRPC requests were not sending headers, which is critical for authentication. Backend logs confirmed . The AI has added debug logging in  (in ) to show credential states and determine why  might be empty. It also implemented logging of the raw response string before deserialization for easier debugging by the user.

3.  **Credentials Persistence and Visibility**: The user requested that credentials should persist across environment changes and application restarts, and be visible by default. They also asked for a Reload Credentials button. The AI has modified  in the frontend to:
    *   Remove logic that cleared credentials on environment changes.
    *   Implement saving and loading of credentials (and current environment) to/from .
    *   Add a  function.
    *   Update the UI to include a Reload Credentials button.
    *   Make the credentials section visible by default.

The last action was editing  to add the Reload Credentials button and make the credentials section visible by default, and the AI is about to import the  icon.
